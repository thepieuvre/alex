    ABSTRACT = { For effective components, non-functional aspects must be added to the application functional code. Likewise enterprise middleware and component platforms, in the context of Grids, services must be deployed at execution in the component containers in order to implement those aspects. This paper proposes an architecture for defining, configuring, and deploying such Technical Services in a Grid platform. },
